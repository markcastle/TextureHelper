This is a simple Java Unity plugin for Android that I'm building as per the tutorial I'm creating at:
https://markcastle.com/steps-to-create-a-native-android-plugin-for-unity-in-java-using-android-studio-part-1-of-2/
https://markcastle.com/steps-to-create-a-native-android-plugin-for-unity-in-java-using-android-studio-part-2-of-2/
I am aiming to show to to create native Unity plugins in Android Studio / Java

The Android Studio Java project that we create in part 1 is in /Src
The Unity3d project where I show how to use the plugin is in /Unity/JavaUnityPlugin

PLease feel free to let me know if there are better ways of doing any of this.

Cheers - Mark
