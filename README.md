# Creating a Native Android Plugin for Unity in Java / Android Studio
This is a simple Java Unity plugin for Android that I'm building as per the tutorial I'm creating at:

* Tutorial [Part One](https://markcastle.com/steps-to-create-a-native-android-plugin-for-unity-in-java-using-android-studio-part-1-of-2/)
* Tutorial [Part Two](https://markcastle.com/steps-to-create-a-native-android-plugin-for-unity-in-java-using-android-studio-part-2-of-2/)

## Why?

I am aiming to show how to create native Unity plugins in Android Studio / Java and also to document the process for myself.  

## Installation

* Download or Clone the Repo (or skip that and start from scratch)
* Navigate to and follow [part one of the tutorial](https://markcastle.com/steps-to-create-a-native-android-plugin-for-unity-in-java-using-android-studio-part-1-of-2/)
* Navigate to and follow [part two of the tutorial](https://markcastle.com/steps-to-create-a-native-android-plugin-for-unity-in-java-using-android-studio-part-2-of-2/)

##The Repo

* The Java project we created in part 1 is in /Src
* The Unity3d project where I show how to use the plugin is in /Unity/JavaUnityPlugin

##FAQ
* Why is it called "TextureHelper"?
Because I am aim to build on the tutorial and show how to write to OpenGL textures in native plugins and them use them in Unity. (Coming Soon)
